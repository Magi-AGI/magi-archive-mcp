# Deployment smoke test for the MCP auth gate (2026-06-14 incident regression).
#
# The hosted MCP server must REJECT unauthenticated requests — an anonymous
# caller must not be able to read restricted/GM content. This catches the whole
# class of failure end-to-end, including causes a unit test can't see (e.g. an
# nginx `proxy_set_header Host 127.0.0.1:3002` that trips the localhost bypass).
#
# Run after every MCP/nginx deploy, or on a schedule as a monitor:
#   scripts/smoke_test_auth_gate.sh
#   BASE_URL=https://dev-mcp.magi-agi.org scripts/smoke_test_auth_gate.sh
#   BASE_URL=https://mcp.hyperon.dev RESTRICTED_CARD="Some+Restricted+Card" scripts/smoke_test_auth_gate.sh
